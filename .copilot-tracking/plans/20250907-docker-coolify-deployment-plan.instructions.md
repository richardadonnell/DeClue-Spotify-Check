# Task Checklist: Docker Deployment for Coolify VPS

## Overview

Prepare the DeClue-Spotify-Check Python application for Docker deployment on Coolify VPS by creating containerization configuration, replacing system cron with Coolify scheduling, and ensuring proper environment variable management.

## Objectives

- Create optimized multi-stage Dockerfile for Python application
- Develop docker-compose.yml for Coolify deployment
- Configure Coolify environment variables and cron scheduling
- Ensure persistent data storage for application state
- Test container functionality and health checks

## Research Summary

### Project Files
- `main.py` - Core Python application with Spotify API integration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (python-dotenv, requests)
- `run_script.sh` - Current Linux cron execution script
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
