# Docker Deployment for Coolify VPS - Implementation Changes

## Date: September 7, 2025

## Overview

Implementation of Docker containerization for DeClue-Spotify-Check Python application to enable deployment on Coolify VPS platform.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Create Docker Configuration

- [x] Task 1.1: Create optimized multi-stage Dockerfile
- [x] Task 1.2: Create docker-compose.yml for Coolify
- [x] Task 1.3: Create .dockerignore file

### Phase 2: Environment and Configuration

- [x] Task 2.1: Update environment variable handling for containers
- [x] Task 2.2: Configure persistent volume mounts
- [x] Task 2.3: Add health check configuration

### Phase 3: Coolify Integration

- [x] Task 3.1: Prepare deployment documentation
- [x] Task 3.2: Create Coolify environment setup guide
- [x] Task 3.3: Document cron scheduling migration

## Files Created/Modified

### Phase 1 Files

- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Python container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Coolify deployment service definition
- `.dockerignore` - Build context optimization

### Phase 2 Files

- `main.py` - Updated for containerized file paths and environment handling

### Phase 3 Files

- `DOCKER-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Docker deployment guide and best practices
- `COOLIFY-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete Coolify platform deployment instructions
- `COOLIFY-ENVIRONMENT.md` - Detailed environment variable configuration guide
- `CRON-MIGRATION.md` - Step-by-step cron scheduling migration documentation

## Implementation Notes

- All Docker configuration files created with security best practices
- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimizes image size and security
- Environment variables properly externalized for container deployment
- Persistent volume configuration ensures data survival across container restarts
- Comprehensive documentation covers all aspects of Coolify deployment
- Cron scheduling migration from Raspberry Pi system cron to Coolify scheduling

## Testing Status

- Docker configuration ready for testing with `docker-compose up --build`
- Health checks configured for container monitoring
- Environment variable validation documented
- Manual testing procedures documented in deployment guides

## Next Steps

âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - All 9 tasks across 3 phases have been successfully completed. The project is ready for Coolify VPS deployment.
